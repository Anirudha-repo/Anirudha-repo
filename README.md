##  Featured Projects

###  Linear Regression
- Implemented simple and multiple linear regression models from scratch and using `scikit-learn`
- Applied to real datasets for prediction and evaluation
- Visualized results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

###  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Built classification models using SVM with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels
- Explored decision boundaries and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluated performance on real datasets

###  K-Means Clustering
- Performed unsupervised customer segmentation using K-Means
- Explained Elbow method, silhouette score, and cluster visualization
- Applied on multivariate datasets with practical use-cases

###  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Designed and trained deep feedforward neural networks using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
- Focused on classification tasks with proper regularization and tuning
- Tracked performance using accuracy/loss curves

###  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Developed basic GAN models to generate synthetic data
- Focused on understanding generator-discriminator dynamics
- Explored practical use in SAR image colorization

##  Project Deployment

Many of these projects include **Flask-based APIs** for real-time model serving. I have tested and documented the endpoints using **Postman**, showcasing how ML/DL models can be integrated into production workflows.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, HTML/CSS (for frontend templates)
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Tools:** Postman, Git, VS Code, Jupyter
